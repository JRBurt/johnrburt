After polishing off some videogames with my buds I started packing my bike at 11:00pm hoping to hop on it and ride off in the early morning, beating Bay Area traffic. Sure, that was the caseâ€¦ but riding up Grizzly Peak I soon realized that I had put too much weight out behind the bike, making me wheelie around a couple of the slower climbing turns. What an idiot. I spent a good forty minutes to an hour redistributing the weight forward while watching the sunrise over the Bay (which was not *terrible*). I was back off, down the winding roads leading to Castro Valley over the San Pablo reservoir. This is Berkeley's version of my cherished Blacksburg road in Catawba, VA. The Grizzly Peak / Redwood Road loop I must have traveled fifty times by now while learning the feel for the bike. It wasn't so different with everything on her luckily. A good sign for the rest of the trip.

Merging onto I-580 was the first real big step in the adventure. I was joining tractor trailers, undoubtedly bringing San Franciscans there almond butter and empty trailers back. Usually a motorcyclists nemesis, they were pretty calming to be around with their predictable movement juxtaposed to commuters zipping past us late for morning meetings.

Welp, blew half the day fixing this GD seal. The nut on the countershaft felt lie it was torqued only about a quarter what it's asked for. A new copper O-ring from Napa, some bargain brand Loctite and RTV silicone gel (What even is this stuff?) and some prayers seemed to fix it just fine. I brought about a gallon of oil just in case I couldn't handle the 170 mile trek from Tonopah to Ely.
