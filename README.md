### Branching

Before making any modifications to the code, create a feature branch off of `develop` so as to pick up other features 
that might not be finalized. Merging should happen with `develop` as the destination branch. Only `develop` should be 
merged into `master`.

#### Branch Example Names
- `update/resume/position`
- `feature/home/fade-out`
- `refactor/assets/consolidating-css`
